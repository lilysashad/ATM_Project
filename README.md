# ATM_Project
Java program that simulates ATM user actions (deposit/withdrawal)

**ATM** is a simple program that mimics an ATM, with a log-in process and ability to withdrawal/deposit funds

Valid users are:
  * Pablo = 82958
  * Xin = 28433
  * Dipti = 14382
  * William = 73858

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Concepts
- [x] HashMaps are used to pair valid usernames and passwords
- [x] Calculation methods for withdrawals/deposits
- [x] Getters/setters for current balance/username/password
- [x] Instead of printing/prompting on screen, implemented lots of alert dialogs
- [x] DecimalFormat is used to correctly show balance
- [x] Inheritance (*extends*) between classes
